# SimCXL

SimCXL is a full-system, cycle-level simulator based on gem5 that provides complete support for all three CXL sub-protocols and all three types of CXL devices. 

CXL-DMSim has been integrated into this work.

SimCXL currently supports CXL protocols as follows:
- CXL.io: Supports both Classic and Ruby subsystems.
- CXL.cache: Supports Ruby subsystem only.
- CXL.mem: Supports both Classic and Ruby subsystems.

SimCXL provides examples for three types of CXL devices:
- CXL Type 1 Accelerator：Uses CXL.io and CXL.cache sub-protocols; supports Ruby subsystem only. It does not have device memory.
- CXL Type 2 Accelerator：Uses CXL.io, CXL.cache, and CXL.mem sub-protocols; supports Ruby subsystem only. It includes device memory.
- CXL Type 3 Memory Expander：Uses CXL.io and CXL.mem sub-protocols; supports both Classic and Ruby subsystems. Note that CXL-DMSim uses the Classic subsystem.


## Requirements

To build SimCXL, you need to satisfy the dependencies of gem5 version 23.10. We recommend running on Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04.

- gcc 9.4.0+
- SCons 3.0+
- Python 3.6+

The main website can be found at [gem5.org](http://www.gem5.org/).

A good starting point is [Introduction to gem5](http://www.gem5.org/Introduction), and for more information about building the simulator and getting started, please see the [Documentation](http://www.gem5.org/Documentation) and [Tutorials](http://www.gem5.org/Tutorials).

## Setup on Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential git m4 scons zlib1g zlib1g-dev \
    libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libprotoc-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev \
    python3-dev python-is-python3 libboost-all-dev pkg-config libpng-dev
```

## Building SimCXL

1. Once you have successfully installed all of the necessary dependencies, you can clone the SimCXL repository to begin working with it.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TianheMICALab/SimCXL.git
   ```

2. When building SimCXL, there are multiple binary types that can be created. Just like in gem5, the options are opt, fast, and debug. In general, the opt version is the best in most circumstances. 

   Additionally, SimCXL currently only supports modeling of the x86 architecture.

   If you only intend to experiment with the CXL Type 3 Memory Expander (including both Classic and Ruby-based versions), type the following command to build the simulator:
   

   ```bash
   scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j`nproc`
   ```

   If you intend to experiment with CXL Type 1 and 2 Accelerators, type the following command to build the simulator:

   ```bash
   # first compile config path, required only for the first build
   scons defconfig build/X86_CXL_MESI build_opts/X86
   scons setconfig build/X86_CXL_MESI RUBY_PROTOCOL_CXL_MESI_TWO_LEVEL=y

   scons build/X86_CXL_MESI/gem5.opt -j`nproc`
   ```

Note that the `-j` flag is optional and allows for parallelization of compilation with `nproc` specifying the number of threads. A single-threaded compilation from scratch can take up to 2 hours on some systems. We therefore strongly advise allocating more threads if possible.

## Using SimCXL

SimCXL is a full-system simulator based on gem5. To start the full system, two files are required: a Linux Kernel and a Disk Image.

- **Linux Kernel**: In full-system mode, gem5 boots the operating system by loading a compiled Linux Kernel, which includes necessary resource management modules and device drivers. We provide a [Linux Kernel](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cwqsqxbZm9pCTW3QK33sZPVulQ8d9Lrl) file with added drivers for CXL devices, version 6.12.
- **Disk Image**: In full-system mode, the simulator relies on the Disk Image to run the simulation programs. Users can copy the executable programs to be tested into the Disk Image for execution after the full system starts. We provide a [Disk Image](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cwqsqxbZm9pCTW3QK33sZPVulQ8d9Lrl) that includes the LMbench, Stream, Viper, and Meric test programs.

Both of these files can be created or compiled following the [gem5 documentation](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/fullsystem/disks), or downloaded from the [gem5 resources repository](https://resources.gem5.org/).

1. Please check that the paths for `Kernel` and `disk_image` in `configs/example/gem5_library/x86-cxl-xxx.py` correspond to the paths on your computer.

2. Enter the following command to start the full system. By default, it allocates CXL-ASIC Device memory to run the lmbench latency benchmark test. The results of the program execution are saved by default in `m5out/board.pc.com_1.device`.

   ```bash
   sudo ./build/X86/gem5.opt configs/example/gem5_library/x86-cxl-type3-with-classic.py
   ```

For more configurable system component parameters, please refer to the [gem5 standard library](https://www.gem5.org/documentation/gem5-stdlib/overview). You can also use `x86-cxl-x86-cxl-type3-with-classic.py` as a reference to customize your system configuration file.

3. Install `m5term` (Optional).

   `m5term` allows users to connect to the simulated terminal provided by the full system. Follow these steps:

   ```bash
   cd util/term
   make
   sudo install -o root -m 555 m5term /usr/local/bin
   ```

   After starting the full system, enter the terminal with the following command:

   ```bash
   m5term localhost 3456
   ```

## CXL Type 3 Memory Expander: Managing CXL Memory in the Full System

CXL Device is recognized as a CPU-less NUMA node in the system. We provide two ways to manage CXL memory allocation.

1. **Via numactl**

   Users can allocate CXL memory using standard numactl commands, for example:

   ```bash
   numactl --membind=1 --cpunodebind=0 ./lat_mem_rd -t -N 2 1024 64
   ```

   This command will run the `lat_mem_rd` program on CPU0, with memory allocation bound to NUMA node 1, which is the CXL memory in the system. You can also use options like `interleave` and `preferred` to mix DRAM and CXL memory.

2. **Via mmap/memkind**

   The CXL device driver provides an mmap system call to allocate CXL memory.

## CXL Type 1/2 Accelerator

CXL accelerators require customization of device functionality based on specific user requirements. We provide a simple Load Store Unit (LSU) as an example. The LSU includes a device cache; it accesses host memory at cacheline granularity via the CXL.cache protocol and caches the data locally. For a concrete example, please refer to `configs/example/gem5_library/x86-cxl-type1-with-ruby.py`.

Notes:
1. By default, the three CXL device configurations boot using KVM (taking approximately 10+ seconds). Upon entering the full system, the simulation automatically switches to the Timing CPU to execute test programs. If KVM is unavailable, it can be replaced with the Atomic CPU, though this will increase the full-system boot time to approximately 30 minutes.

2. The Ruby subsystem is significantly slower than the Classic subsystem. To accelerate experiments, we recommend reducing the experimental scale and running multiple gem5 instances in parallel.

3. Currently, the ATS address translation mechanism and the Back-Invalidate mechanism are not yet implemented.
